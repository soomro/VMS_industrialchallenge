
Niclas Meeting:

prepared by: Abdullah Arslan

final report
-> our document is like activity journal! describe product
-> customer will read and decide to buy or not to buy, explain the product
-> show also feasibility
-> lack of reference, we should search crisis area and reference
there is many other similar work, we should read them and use them
-> How can i trust your sayings, if you use and reference other scientific researches, your saying will be stronger
To strengthen our idea, we need to refer other works

-> Second point ???
scenerio...
(Niclas talked about a scenerio, i could not understand)

-> describe the product via most important use cases

TASK 1 - Rewrite the final report

---------------------------------------
SRS

Requirement should be simple, atomic, providing validation criteria
each requirement has a short description, ID desc, verification criteria

Requirement specification should be easy understandable
another person from outside can understand easily

find a way for expressing our Functional reqs. 

-> recommendation : prepare a state diagram 
home page to which pages

for each page, which requirements are needed
which data is used
which nonfunctional requirements are mapped to this page
who should access this page


-> so that, when implementing the system, it will be easy to verify the requirements

did we fulfiled all requirements for this page?


Task 2 -> prepare this structure and requirements

there is a seperation between use cases and requirements
the relation is "refine". "use cases refine requirements"
this is a begin of high level architecture

* the structure will be used for validation, data model, use cases , requirements

* everything must be clear, a foreign person can easily unders
and

---------------------------------------------------------
prepare data model, ensure CRUD is fulfiled in web pages 
( I think this was suggestion, not a must )
