Supervisory Meeting 11:00 - 12:30
--------------------
USE CASES
* Add description row to use cases.

* For all use cases, final step must the system response

* All use cases must be in this format : user interaction, system response, user interaction, system response...

* express the inheritance of use cases in the diagram. If any use case uses another one, show it in the diagram.

* use case names must be like 'Sending Request", not 'Send Request'
-> A.A : I think, this is not correct. Search the web for use case examples. None of the examples uses '...ing ...' format.
